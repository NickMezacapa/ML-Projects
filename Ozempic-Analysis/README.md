## Quantifying Social Media Discourse on Anti-Obesity Medications

### Introduction

Medications designed to combat obesity are typically recommended alongside a regimen of nutritious eating, regular physical activity, and behavior adjustments. Nevertheless, there have been instances of low compliance with these prescriptions. It's crucial to investigate patients' attitudes and beliefs concerning these drugs, as they might significantly impact how patients follow their treatment plans. Examining tweets has emerged as a valuable instrument in the realm of health research.
