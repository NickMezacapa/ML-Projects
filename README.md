# AI/ML Projects ðŸ¤–

This repository contains a list of projects that I have worked on. The projects are *<b>not</b>* listed in the order of their completion. As I continue learning, more projects will be frequently added to this repository.<br>
<br>

Each project has a `README.md` file that contains a brief description of the project, the dataset used, the libraries used, and the steps to run the project. I'm fascinated by the implementations of machine learning in healthcare, so I've tried to tailor my projects to be relatively healthcare-related. I hope you find these projects useful and interesting!
